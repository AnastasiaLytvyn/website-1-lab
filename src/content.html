        Felis catus has had a very long relationship with humans. Ancient
        Egyptians may have first domesticated cats as early as 4,000 years ago.
        Plentiful rodents probably drew wild felines to human communities. The
        cats' skill in killing them may have first earned the affectionate
        attention of humans. Early Egyptians worshipped a cat goddess and even
        mummified their beloved pets for their journey to the next
        worldâ€”accompanied by mummified mice! Cultures around the world later
        adopted cats as their own companions.
