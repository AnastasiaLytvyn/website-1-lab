            Felis catus has had a very long relationship with humans. 
            Ancient Egyptians may have first domesticated cats as early as 4,000 years ago. 
            Plentiful rodents probably drew wild felines to human communities. 
            The cats' skill in killing them may have first earned the affectionate attention of humans. 
            Early Egyptians worshipped a cat goddess and even mummified their beloved pets for their journey to the next worldâ€”accompanied by mummified mice! 
            Cultures around the world later adopted cats as their own companions.
